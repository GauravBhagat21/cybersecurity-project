# Cybersecurity Project

## Overview

This is a security‑focused project implemented in Rust. It includes configurations for cross‑compilation (`Cross.toml`), a `Dockerfile`, build scripts (`build.rs`), and resource files. The aim is to build a secure tool or service with emphasis on containerization, reproducible builds, and security practices.

---

## Features

- **Rust-based implementation** for memory safety and performance
- **Cross-compilation support** (`Cross.toml`) to build for multiple platforms
- **Dockerfile** for containerized execution
- **Security policy** (`SECURITY.md`) for vulnerability reporting
- **Roadmap** (`ROADMAP.md`) for future project plans
- Resource and config files (`resources/`, `services.txt`, `adsfund.json`, `giscus.json`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional)

### Clone & Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GauravBhagat21/cybersecurity-project.git
cd cybersecurity-project

# Build locally
cargo build --release

# OR build with Docker
docker build -t cybersecurity-project .
```

### Run

```bash
# After local build
./target/release/your_binary_name
```

or with Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm cybersecurity-project
```

---

## Roadmap

Future enhancements are listed in `ROADMAP.md`. Possible upcoming features:

- Additional security checks / integrations
- More cross‑platform builds
- CI/CD pipeline automation

---

## Security

See `SECURITY.md` for details about reporting vulnerabilities.
